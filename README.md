# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction
Prediction of Diabetes Risk in Individual by Different Machine Learning Models\

In this task, we will do an EDA and data cleaning on the collected dataset from BRFSS. Then, we will use some good ML models for the prediction (Diabetes or not) task and compare their performance based on some matrices (i.e. Accuracy, Precision, AUC, f1 score, etc.)\

Data Source: The raw dataset has been collected from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. It is a health-related survey. Each year, this survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on chronic health issues, health-related risk behaviors, and the use of preventative services.\

Major research areas:\

Do the survey questions from the BRFSS provide a good-quality prediction of whether an individual has diabetes or not?
What risk factors are most predictive of diabetes risk?
Can a subset of the risk factors (by feature sorting) be used to accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes or not?
In this way, can we create a short form of questions from the BRFSS using features (from feature sorting or selection) to accurately predict if someone might have diabetes or is at high risk of diabetes?\

Note: A good documentaion has been provided in the .ipynb file to understand the each step of this Diabetes prediction task. Please follow the above-mentioned file.
